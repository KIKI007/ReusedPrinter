# ReusedPrinter
Three-dimensional (3D) printers such as fused deposition modeling
(FDM) need to add supports to a digital model in order to be printed. The additional supports using the same or different materials have several drawbacks such as the supports are a waste of materials and the support printing and removing is time-consuming. We develop a new type of metal supports that serve as the trunks of the required supports to reduce the printed supports. When finishing the printing of a layer, the metal rods will be moved up the same layer distance as the printer head. The stop positions of the metal rods are set by metal tubes with pre-defined lengths. After the printing process, the metal rods can easily be removed and reused. Since the lengths of the pre-fabricated metal tube is not continous, additional printing support would be required in certain circumstances. We have developed a new support generating algorithm to address this problem. A prototype FDM 3D printer has been developed to demonstrate the metal support method, and several test cases are presented to show its effectiveness and efficiency.

融融堆积技术的三维打印机器需要增加额外于原数字模型的支撑来保障打印的质量。这些而外的支撑无论使用与原模型相同或不同的材料都会有不少的局限：包括大量打印材料的浪费和额外耗时的打印和去支撑过程。我们开发出了一款新型的预装金属支撑的打印机，其中金属支撑将作为原先需要添加额外打印支撑的主题以此大幅度减少额外支撑的使用。在完成一次打印之时，打印喷头会和金属支撑一起移动至下一层，保证打印过程不会碰撞的发生。金属支撑停止的位置由预制金属管的长度来决定。打印过程结束以后，金属支撑可以很容易移除并再次使用。由于可预制金属管的长度并不连续，实际例子中需要少量打印支撑。故我们也同时设计基于该打印机的额外支撑的算法应对该问题。我们已完成一个原型机的制造，可展示该金属支撑打印机的全工作流程。在此基础之上完成了实际的例子开展检测，经测试该机器功能良好，效率相较于传统打印机大幅提高。
